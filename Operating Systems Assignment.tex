\section{OS Theory}

\subsection{What is a multiprocessing system?}
A multiprocessing system uses two or more physical processor cores that
can each execute distinct code simultaneously. (\cite{silberschatz_operating_2018})

    \subsubsection{Examples}
    Many modern web browsers, such as Google Chrome. run each tab
    in its own process. The advantages of this approach include providing
    "better performance, security, and reliability for your browser tabs" (\cite{parmar_microsoft_2020})
    While multiprocessing is not the primary goal of this,
    it allows for multiple tabs to execute code simultaneously.

    \subsubsection{Benefits}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A multiprocessing system is more scalable as it is easier
              and more power efficient to add additional CPU cores than
              it is to increase the performance of individual cores.
        \item An application utilizing multithreading is likely to perform
              better than a single-threaded application as modern CPUs are
              designed with many cores. A multithreaded application can use
              multiple of these cores at a time for different tasks to avoid
              being bottlenecked by a single task.
        \item A multiprocessing system can be more responsive. For example,
              if a thread is dedicated to updating the user interface,
              then the UI will remain responsive even if other threads are
              performing a long task such as accessing a file.
    \end{enumerate}

\subsection{The difference between a process and a thread?}
A process is an instance of a program currently running on the system.
A thread, meanwhile, is the smallest unit of execution scheduled by the operating system.
Each thread belongs to a process, and each process has one or more threads.

Different threads within the same process share the same memory which includes any
statically or dynamically allocated variables. Each thread has its own stack and registers
which store local variables.
Different processes have separate memory spaces, even if they are running the same program.

A process that requires multiprocessing will typically create multiple threads
rather than multiple processes as creating and communicating between processes is
more expensive than with threads.

    \subsubsection{Scenario 1}
    You're writing a report in Microsoft Office. While you are typing, the text is
    displayed, and spelling and grammar are checked.

    This is an example of a process using multiple threads.
    One thread is responsible for displaying the text, while another thread is responsible
    for checking spelling and grammar in it.

    Both threads need to access the same resource, the text being written, and therefore
    need to be part of the same process to share the same memory space.

    \subsubsection{Scenario 2}
    You're writing a report in Microsoft Office while listening to online music from
    iTunes.

    This is an example of multiple processes. Office and iTunes don't need to share
    memory and are different applications running different code, so they are run as
    separate processes.


\subsection{What is a race condition?}
A race condition occurs when two or more threads attempt to access the same resource,
such as a variable, at the same time. This can result in unexpected behaviour such as
one thread overwriting the value written by another thread while the other thread is
still using the value.

    \subsubsection{What is a mutex?}
    A mutex ensures that only one thread can access a resource at a time.
    Before a thread accesses a shared resource, it must first lock the mutex associated with it.
    If the mutex is already locked, the thread will wait until it is unlocked.
    Once the thread is finished with the resource, it unlocks the mutex so that other
    threads can access it.

    \subsubsection{What is a semaphore and how does it differ?}
    A semaphore is similar to a mutex, except that it allows one or more threads to hold
    a lock at a time instead of just one. A semaphore is initialised with a value
    that indicates the number of locks that can be held at a time. (\cite{linux_manual_sem_init3_nodate}) (\cite{linux_manual_sem_wait3_nodate})

    Similar to a mutex, a thread must first lock the semaphore before accessing the shared resource.
    If there are no locks available, the thread will wait until one becomes available.
    The thread then unlocks the semaphore when it is finished with the resource.
    The lock count is decremented by one when the semaphore is locked and incremented
    when it is unlocked.

    Semaphores can be used instead of mutexes when a resource has limited capacity,
    such as with I/O devices, but can still be safely accessed by multiple threads at the same time.

\subsection{What happens during a context switch?}

During a context switch, the state of the current thread
is saved to memory as a Process Control Block (PCB). The state includes the values of registers, the program counter
and the stack pointer.

The state of the next thread to run (which can be part of a different process) when it was last executed,
including its registers and stack pointer,
is then loaded into the CPU. The program counter is then set to the address
specified in the PCB and execution continues in the new thread.

A context switch is triggered when an interrupt, such as the thread
running for too long, occurs or a system call is made, such as printing
to the console.

A context switch can be between two threads in the same process or between
two separate processes. The process is the same for both scenarios.

\section{The Lunar Lander Controller}{
    % https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/74529/sections-indexed-with-numbers-subsections-with-letters
    \renewcommand{\thesubsection}{\thesection.\alph{subsection}}

    \subsection{Threads and Semaphores in Code}
        The controller uses 5 threads for the following purposes:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Display update.
            \item Keyboard input.
            \item Lander communication.
            \item Dashboard communication.
            \item Data logging.
        \end{enumerate}

        \subsubsection{Semaphore and Thread Alternatives}

        As an alternative to using semaphores and threads, the application could instead
        use a single thread that updates every component in sequence. This would eliminate
        the need for semaphores as there would be no possibility of race conditions.

        Additionally, the dashboard thread could be its own process as it only needs to forward data
        from the lander server to the dashboard client, which could be requested by the dashboard controller itself.

        Data logging can not be its own process as it requires data from the user input thread which is
        not sent by any request from the lander server.

        \subsubsection{Advantages and Disadvantages of Threads in the Program}
        Using threads simplifies running different components at different frequencies as each thread can
        sleep for the required amount of time without affecting any of the other threads.

        Additionally, if one thread fails to run, such as the dashboard thread being unable to send data,
        this will not affect any other threads which improves overall stability.

        However, the use of threads makes the program as a whole more complex as any shared variables
        must be protected by semaphores to prevent race conditions.

        While threads have less overhead than processes, they are not free. As a result, the program may
        use more system resources multithreaded than it would if it was single-threaded.

        \subsubsection{User Input Management}
        The program uses a separate thread to handle user input. This thread continuously polls
        the keyboard using the \code{key\textunderscore pressed} function. If a key is pressed,
        \code{landercommand} is updated based on the key pressed.

        \code{key\textunderscore pressed} calls \code{wgetch} which returns the \code{ERR} macro if
        the input queue is empty. A while loop is used to continuously call \code{wgetch} until a key
        is pressed.

        \code{wgetch} then pops the key from the input queue and returns it (\cite{linux_manual_wgetch3_nodate}),
        this ensures that each keypress is only processed once.

    \subsection{TCP Compared to UDP}
    \subsubsection{TCP Implementation}
    The following changes are required in order to communicate with the lander
    via TCP instead of UDP:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item getaddr and mksocket need an extra parameter for the socket type.
        \item SOCK\textunderscore DGRAM must be changed to the socket type
              parameter in getaddr and mksocket.
        \item SOCK\textunderscore STREAM must be passed to getaddr and mksocket in the lander thread.
        \item The socket must be connected the lander using the \code{connect}
              function prior to communicating as TCP is connection oriented.
        \item \code{sendto} and \code{recvfrom} must be replaced with \code{send}
              and \code{recv} respectively. The fifth and sixth parameters containing
              the address of the lander and its length must be removed as they are
              instead stored with the socket.
        \item The new socket type parameter must be passed as SOCK\textunderscore DGRAM in
              the dashboard thread as this still uses UDP.
    \end{enumerate}

    See tcp\textunderscore implementation.c in the appendix for the full
    code of the changed functions. Lines that have been changed are marked
    with comments starting with "TCP".

    \subsubsection{Advantages and disadvantages of UDP and TCP}
    Using UDP for communication is simpler than TCP as it does not require establishing a connection,
    however, UDP does not guarantee that packets will be received in the same
    order they were sent or at all. This may result in the dashboard receiving
    incorrect or no data and the lander receiving incorrect commands.

    As the code is structured to make a single request to the lander then
    wait for a response indefinitely, a deadlock will occur if either the
    request or response is dropped.

    Using TCP would prevent all of these issues as it guarantees that packets
    will be received and that they will be processed in the same order they
    were sent.

    \subsection{Data Logging}

        \subsubsection{What data is logged and why?}
        All data that is shown on the display is logged. This consists of:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Log index.
            \item Rotation and thrust commands.
            \item Last input.
            \item Fuel.
            \item Altitude.
            \item Contact state.
            \item Position.
            \item Velocity.
            \item Angle.
            \item Angular velocity.
        \end{itemize}

        The data is logged in the following format:
        \lstinputlisting{sample_log.txt}

        \subsubsection{What are the advantages and disadvantages of logging five times per second?}
        Logging five times per second results in the log being more accurate than if it was logged less frequently
        as it contains more data points and therefore is more likely to contain brief events that could otherwise
        be missed.

        However, logging more frequently results in the log file growing at a faster rate as discussed below. This
        may result in the file using a significant amount of disk space if the program is running for a long time.
        Additionally, the log will be more difficult to read as it contains more data points that a user would
        have to look through. This could be mitigated by logging in a machine-readable format such as JSON or XML.

        \subsubsection{How often would data be logged if not five times per second?}
        If the data was not required to be logged five times per second, it could instead be logged every 500ms
        as this is the frequency at which the display is updated. This would reduce the rate at which the log
        file grows to 500 bytes per second.

        \subsubsection{{What rate does the size of the file grow?}}
        The log file grows at a rate of approximately 1250 bytes per second.
        This was calculated based on a log consisting of 100 entries and having
        a size of 25kb. \mbox{(25000 / 100) * 5 = 1250}
}
